## What's Coding Dojo?

A Coding Dojo is a meeting where people with different skill levels get together in a non-competitive environment to solve a problem.

## What's Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is related with test-firs programming concepts of Extreme Programming (XP), begun in 1999. In 2003 Kent Beck "rediscovered" the method and created more public interest. The technique state that the test should be created before the code. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

Combining these two techniques and we have various interesting challenges to solve!!
